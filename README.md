Samba is an [Ethereum portal client](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) written in Java language based
on [Teku](https://github.com/Consensys/teku) and [Besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu).
The name is inspired by the shortened name of of rescue dog named Sambayon that is the Spanish translation of an Italian dessert.

> **Note:** Samba is still **under heavy development** and is not yet ready for production use.

## Build Instructions

### Install Prerequisites

* Java 21+

Building on a more recent version of Java is supported, but the resulting build will not work on earlier versions of Java.


### Build and Dist

To create a ready to run distribution:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/meldsun0/samba
cd samba && ./gradlew

```

This produces:
- Fully packaged distribution in `build/distributions`
### Build and Test

To build, clone this repo and run with `gradle`:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/meldsun0/samba
cd samba && ./gradlew

```

After a successful build, distribution packages are available in `build/distributions`.

### Other Useful Gradle Targets

| Target       | Builds                                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| distTar      | Full distribution in build/distributions (as `.tar.gz`) |
| distZip      | Full distribution in build/distributions (as `.zip`)    |
| distDocker   | The `meldsun/samba` docker image                        |
| dockerUpload | Push imges to Docker Hub                                |
| runContainer | A docker container running                              |

## Code Style

We use Google's Java coding conventions for the project. To reformat code, run:

```shell script
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Code style is checked automatically during a build.

## Testing

All the unit tests are run as part of the build, but can be explicitly triggered with:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```

## Docker

## Running Hive locally

To run Hive locally against Samab you should follow these instractions: 

Clone Hive:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/hive
go build .
go build ./cmd/hiveview  
```

Build a local Docker image from Samba:
```shell script
./gradlew build         
./gradlew distDocker  
```

* Copy hive/samba folder to hive/clients
* Change /hive/samba/Dockerfile by adding the recent created image. 

Run Hive tests:
```shell script
./hive -sim portal -client samba,trin -sim.limit history 
```
View logs output and results:
```shell script
./hiveview --serve --logdir ./workspace/logs
```
## JSON-RPC API 
- portal_historyPing
- portal_historyFindNodes
- portal_historyAddEnr
- portal_historyGetEnr
- portal_historyDeleteEnr


- discv5_nodeInfo, 
- discv5_updateNodeInfo, 
- discv5_getEnr

When running against Hive there should be 33 tests passing.
